# Redwine-Quality-EDA-Project
This project I did for my Term 1 and 2 for EDA analysis in my journey of becoming a data scientist. I believe this project gives a lot of insights about the wines and the difference. This is still and ongoing part of the study. More frequents updates will come into this.

In this project the DS is considering only the red wine data set and going through all the dataset and using various comparisions and all find the first solution, which is the alcohol percentage the higher makes the wine a better.


So, going further I will improve the Readme section, with more precise information.
